# BETTR SOCIAL — FULL PRODUCT + FRONTEND BUILD PROMPT (CURSOR)

## PRODUCT OVERVIEW

I am building a next-generation social media web application called **Bettr**.

Bettr is a user-first social network designed to replace platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, X, and TikTok by fixing their structural problems:
- opaque algorithms
- doomscrolling
- data exploitation
- brand unsafety
- bot-driven engagement

Bettr introduces a **user-controlled main feed ("Bettr Feed")**, a **decentralized algorithm marketplace**, **scheduled content controls**, a **Curriculum of Content**, and **fair user/creator compensation**, all built on a privacy-first and identity-verified foundation.

This project is being built as a **hackathon MVP**, but the architecture, UI, and logic must be **production-aligned and integration-ready**.

## TARGET USERS

Primary:
- University students (18–25)
- Young professionals
- Creators, journalists, educators

Secondary:
- Ethical brands and advertisers
- Algorithm developers
- AI assistant creators

Users value:
- Control over algorithms
- Transparency
- Mental wellbeing
- Fair rewards
- Verified, bot-free spaces

---

## CORE MVP FEATURES (WHAT MUST BE BUILT)

### 1. BETTR FEED (FOUNDATION)
**(Bounty 2 – Decentralized Algorithm Marketplace)**

- Unified feed combining:
  - long-form posts
  - short videos
  - journalism-style content
  - community notes
- Feed ranking changes dynamically based on selected algorithm
- Algorithm control side panel:
  - toggle algorithms on/off
  - see which algorithm is active
  - preview what other users are using
- Feed logic is state-based (no real algorithm execution in MVP)

---

### 2. ALGORITHM MARKETPLACE
**(Bounty 2 – Core Equity Target)**

- Marketplace of algorithm *profiles* (not executable ML code)
- Each algorithm includes:
  - name
  - description
  - intent (e.g. study, news, social)
  - popularity / trust indicator
- Users can:
  - browse
  - activate
  - deactivate
  - import/export algorithms (simulated)
- UI must feel like:
  - Spotify playlists
  - App Store cards

---

### 3. SCHEDULED CONTENT CONTROLS
**(Bounty 3 – Algorithmic Productivity & Wellness Scheduler)**

- Calendar-based scheduler UI
- Users assign algorithms to:
  - time blocks
  - days of the week
- Feed switches automatically based on schedule (simulated)
- Goal:
  - combat doomscrolling
  - support focus and wellbeing
- Scheduler visually represents the **Curriculum of Content**

---

### 4. CURRICULUM OF CONTENT
**(Bounty 5 – Gamified Education, MVP-lite)**

- Content tagged by focus areas:
  - Mental Health
  - Physical Health
  - Academic Progression
  - Vocational Upskilling
  - Nutrition
- Users see:
  - progress indicators
  - completion states
  - preview badges
- Badges are visual only (no real credential issuance)

---

### 5. REWARDS & COMPENSATION DASHBOARD
**(Bounty 4 – Privacy-First Monetization, MVP-lite)**

- Users earn points for:
  - completing scheduled blocks
  - engaging with positive / educational content
- Dashboard shows:
  - balance
  - history
  - earning explanations
- Crypto, Solana Pay, ZKP logic is **explained but not executed**

---

## CONCEPTUAL / UI-ONLY FEATURES (EXPLAIN, DO NOT FULLY BUILD)

### 6. AI ASSISTANT & DIGITAL ASSET MARKETPLACE
**(Bounty 6)**

AI Assistants:
- Academic mentor
- Wellness coach
- Career assistant
- Nutrition assistant

Digital Assets:
- creator skins
- digital fashion
- mixed reality items

MVP includes:
- marketplace UI
- assistant preview cards
- purchase flow mockups

---

### 7. VERIFIED IDENTITY & BRAND SAFETY
**(Bounty 1 – Institutional Identity & Global Student Onboarding)**

UI flows must include:
- University discovery (WAYF-style selector)
- Explanation of verification process
- Account status indicator (verified student)

Conceptual integration:
- Jisc / OpenAthens
- OpenAthens Keystone (OIDC ↔ SAML bridge)
- Shibboleth IdP attributes:
  - eduPersonPrincipalName
  - eduPersonAffiliation
- GDPR-compliant pseudonymous identifiers

NO real SSO integration required in MVP.

---

## FRONTEND & UI BUILD REQUIREMENTS (IMPORTANT)

### FRAMEWORK & STACK
- React + Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Deployed via Vercel

### UI SOURCES
- Figma designs already exist
- Build structure, hierarchy, and interaction fidelity
- Pixel-perfect accuracy is NOT required

### UI PRINCIPLES
- Calm, ethical, brand-safe
- Modern but not overstimulating
- Clear information hierarchy
- User feels in control at all times

### REQUIRED UI COMPONENTS
- Header with navigation
- Bettr Feed container
- Algorithm side panel
- Algorithm cards
- Scheduler calendar
- Curriculum progress widgets
- Rewards dashboard
- Marketplace grids
- Modal flows (switch, preview, explain)

### STATE MANAGEMENT
- Selected algorithm
- Active schedule block
- User progress
- Reward balance
- Verification status

---

## SECURITY & AUTH (UI + ARCHITECTURE READY)

- Auth UI supports:
  - verified student onboarding
  - future OAuth / OIDC flows
- Architecture must allow:
  - Jisc / OpenAthens integration
  - role-based access
- No passwords stored in MVP
- No sensitive PII collected

---

## BLOCKCHAIN & DECENTRALIZATION (INTEGRATION-READY)

Do NOT implement blockchain logic.

Explain and architect for:
- Solana (L1)
- Solana Pay
- Token-2022 (transfer hooks)
- ZK Proofs (privacy-preserving ads)
- Metaplex DAS / MPL Core
- SPL-404 hybrid assets

All blockchain interactions are:
- mocked
- commented
- visually explained

---

## DESIGN VIBE

- “Social, But Better”
- Spotify-like control
- Calm productivity apps
- Transparent dashboards
- No dark patterns
- No infinite scroll without intent

---

## EXPECTED OUTPUT FROM CURSOR

- Clean, readable, modular React components
- Clear separation of UI and logic
- No unnecessary backend complexity
- No hallucinated APIs
- Build incrementally:
  1. Bettr Feed
  2. Algorithm switching
  3. Marketplace
  4. Scheduler
  5. Rewards
  6. Conceptual pages

---

## DEMO USER STORY

A verified student logs into Bettr.
They select a “Study Mode” algorithm in the morning.
Their feed reorders instantly.
The scheduler later switches them to “Social Discovery.”
They earn rewards for completing a learning block.
They explore the algorithm marketplace.
They understand *why* they see content — and feel in control.

---

Build this as a **deployable, explainable, integration-ready MVP**.
